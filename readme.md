# HaeChat

Live Chat Application created with Go. This project is a work in progress. The desired outcome of this project is to create a live chat application that can be used by multiple users at once. The application will be built using Go and will use websockets to allow for real-time communication between users. 

And the front-end will be built using HTML, Tailwind, and JavaScript  

For Frontend you can implement it yourself using any language or framework for free. You can also use the front-end that I will be building. 
You can also host the server on your own machine or you can use the server that I will be hosting. Its up to you. 

TLDR : This project is being created to help me learn Go and websockets and to create live chat application that easy to implement and use for everyone.
